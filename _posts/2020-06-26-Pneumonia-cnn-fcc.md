title: Classification of Chest X-ray Images for Pneumonia using Transfer Learning in Pytorch
---
### Introduction
This is my first project on deep learning (especially Convolutional Neural Networks) with Pytorch. In this project, I will be using the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). The dataset initially organized into 3 folders such as 'train','val' and 'test'. Each contains subfolders for each category such as 'Pneumonia' and 'Normal'.
The code snippets below are from Jupyter Notebook which you can find on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/babyyawlwi)
